We are looking for a talented **intern** to join our studio this winter.

As an intern, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to experience working in a multidisciplinary studio with a small, tight-knit team. We are designers who think in code. Your passion and interest in coding, communication, typography, design, writing, animation, or illustration are all welcomed and encouraged here. 

You will continue to learn, hone your skills, and contribute valuable work to real projects (and fun side-projects) for the web and mobile devices. 

### Ideal candidates should have:

- Self-motivation and good work ethic
- Eagerness to learn new things
- Strong communication skills
- Good understanding of our products
- Strong coding skills. You'll have the opportunity to immerse yourself in Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Swift, React, Sass, and modern JavaScript.

This is a paid internship located at our studio in Brooklyn, NY and commitment is flexible. Past interns have went on to work for companies like Facebook, Hyperakt, and here at Oak.
