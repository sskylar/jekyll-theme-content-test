Jonnie Hallman is toughâ€”he sits in an ergonomic kneeling chair and uses a Wacom pen. He prefers handshakes over hugs, looks for jokes in every situation, and consistently ruins tear-jerkers. Jonnie worked at Adobe for several years, first as a mobile developer, then as a prototype designer. Now, he builds apps, fulfilling any role necessary to ship a good product.
