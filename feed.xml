For the first few years it was barely a company, just myself and one client. It wasn’t until 2010 that I nervously hired my first employee and began on the path that would ultimately lead us to today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of Oak’s existence we’ve been a client-oriented web design shop. This began primarily out of necessity, but thanks to our amazing team&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:team&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:team&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, we’ve done a &lt;a href=&quot;/helping&quot;&gt;mighty fine job&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just a few highlights so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Craig Shapiro and Zach Frechette came to us with an idea. We worked to name, brand, and launch what became &lt;a href=&quot;http://quarterly.co&quot;&gt;Quarterly.co&lt;/a&gt;, growing them to a point where they could &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/quarterly-series-a/&quot;&gt;raise funding&lt;/a&gt; and hire an in-house team (we loved the idea so much, we decided to &lt;a href=&quot;/building&quot;&gt;invest&lt;/a&gt; ourselves).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We repeated this success in 2012 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://workingnotworking.com&quot;&gt;Working Not Working&lt;/a&gt;, helping Justin Gignac and Adam Tompkins grow an idea into a platform that connects freelancers with companies that want to hire them. WNW was able to also &lt;a href=&quot;http://adage.com/article/agency-news/working-working-funding-droga5-airbnb/300064/&quot;&gt;raise funding&lt;/a&gt; and transition to an in-house team, the definition of success to us. This project also earned us our first Webby award.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014 we were &lt;a href=&quot;/thinking/net-awards/&quot;&gt;nominated for Agency of the Year&lt;/a&gt; by the Net Awards. We didn’t win, but it was still pretty cool to be nominated alongside legit agencies we look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2014, we spent 2 months working alongside the in-house team at &lt;a href=&quot;/helping/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. We did some quality work, while getting a rare insider look at how a company at that scale operates. Especially interesting in contrast to our 4-person team.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:newsletter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:newsletter&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects have been rewarding, but alongside working with clients, we’ve also been lucky enough to launch our very own products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First in 2011, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com&quot;&gt;Dropmark&lt;/a&gt; as a collaborative tool for visual organization and bookmarking. Working on projects with clients, we constantly found ourselves wanting to grab a handful of images or links and share them (inspiration, comps, etc) so we built Dropmark to serve this purpose. We wanted it to be simple, somewhere you could just toss a couple things and get a link back without much fuss. It’s come a long way since this &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/20635463&quot;&gt;rather embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; launch video. Dropmark is now on the web, Mac OS X, and soon iOS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dropmark.typeform.com/to/jTbcNs&quot;&gt;now in beta&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 we launched our second product &lt;a href=&quot;http://symbolset.com&quot;&gt;Symbolset&lt;/a&gt;, built to bring semantics and meaning to icons. Designing interfaces, we quickly learned there was much room for improvement in this space, and we’re &lt;a href=&quot;/thinking/symbolset-next&quot;&gt;excited about its future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 we launched a content management system called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siteleaf.com&quot;&gt;Siteleaf&lt;/a&gt;, and re-launched with a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siteleaf.com/blog/v2/&quot;&gt;v2&lt;/a&gt; just a couple weeks ago. Continuing the trend, Siteleaf was also built to scratch our itch. We made enough websites for clients to know most CMS backends were overkill for the average website. Siteleaf is a static website generator built on Jekyll and made for a better web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating products is hard work, but over the years each have grown to find passionate audiences. They have also attracted the attention of investors and companies looking to make their next acqui-hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a moment of weakness, we once found ourselves in a hotel boardroom with a catered breakfast bar and a table full of suit-wearing executives. They gave us a multi-million dollar offer to join their team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people this would’ve been a dream exit, but for us the decision couldn’t have been clearer as the conversation drifted away from our products and dreams to theirs. We ended up walking away, and I’m still proud of that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our vision of what Oak is has become clearer, and this experience certainly helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Oak 2.0, we’ve taken steps to be more product focused and continue building our ideas into self-sustaining products. We love calling our own shots, care deeply about building things that matter, and are proud to be 100% bootstrapped. We’re not into exit plans, products that gamify users, or using unethical dark patterns to squeeze a profit. Can we make the products we want and focus on the user first, while still making profit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everything else in Oak’s history, &lt;strong&gt;let’s ship it and find out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To commemorate the launch of Oak 2.0, I’m also excited to announce that Sawyer Hollenshead, who originally started with Oak in 2012, is joining me as co-founder. We have a lot of big ideas on where we want to take Oak, so this is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might’ve also noticed, we have a &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;brand new website&lt;/a&gt; that better reflects who we are and where we’re going. We hope you like it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Skylar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. we are &lt;a href=&quot;/hiring&quot;&gt;growing our team&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn. If you’re into what we’re doing, we’d love to meet you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Shoutout to all Oak people past and present who helped us get here: Justin, Ethan, Larry, Mike, Jonnie, Alonzo, and Adam.

From early &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting&quot;&gt;cave paintings&lt;/a&gt;, carved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs&quot;&gt;hieroglyphs&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_pictograms&quot;&gt;modern pictograms&lt;/a&gt; as seen and recognized in every restroom and airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbols break down language barriers, and allow us to communicate more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/symbolset-dot.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation pictograms, 1974&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://symbolset.com&quot;&gt;Symbolset&lt;/a&gt; is a platform for making symbols semantic and accessible, returning iconography to its roots as a communication device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the story of why we built Symbolset at Oak, why icon fonts matter now more than ever, and what’s next for Symbolset as a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/42300865&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozalowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Symbolset teaser, 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2011, and the state of stock icons for user interface design was pretty bleak. At Oak, choosing icons for a client project typically meant wasting hours sifting through folders of crudely drawn vector files, bringing these into Photoshop to apply snazzy emboss effects&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:emboss&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:emboss&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and exporting these as PNGs. If you are someone like our designer Mike Fortress, you also spend time cleaning up stray points in Illustrator and reconciling inconsistencies between icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repetitive process had Mike thinking about designing his own set of icons. As he was already dabbling in typeface design, he aimed to create a well-crafted set of icons drawn with the sensibility and discipline of a cohesive typeface. In fact, why not make it a typeface? That’s a thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icon-fonts&quot;&gt;Icon fonts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbol fonts are not a new concept. They have been used throughout the history of the printing press, sold and used alongside type as ornaments, and commonly referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat&quot;&gt;dingbats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years our computers have shipped with common symbol fonts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats&quot;&gt;Zapf Dingbats&lt;/a&gt; (1978) which would eventually become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/dingbats/list.htm&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html&quot;&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings&quot;&gt;Wingdings&lt;/a&gt; (1990); and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdings&quot;&gt;Webdings&lt;/a&gt; (1997) designed by, among others, &lt;a href=&quot;http://connare.com/&quot;&gt;Vincent Connare&lt;/a&gt; of Comic Sans fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 was a hot year for webfonts, Adobe had just acquired Typekit. We saw people experimenting with putting user interface icons into webfonts. Interesting things were happening, but something wasn’t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;made-with-k-in-nyc&quot;&gt;Made with k in NYC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo.com&lt;/a&gt; used one of the more popular icon fonts in their footer with the message “Made with ❤️ in NYC”. However, since this particular font mapped icons to A-Z characters, it actually said “Made with &lt;strong&gt;k&lt;/strong&gt; in NYC”. This is how Google and screen readers would have interpreted the icon, and it made us think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Symbolset, we aimed to make icons meaningful, easy, and accessible for both humans &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach is three-fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semantically map icons to Unicode standards. A heart should map to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2764/index.htm&quot;&gt;U+2764&lt;/a&gt;, so a heart is a heart not a letter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/006b/index.htm&quot;&gt;k&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use OpenType ligature features to represent common terms in icon form while retaining screen reader accessibility (a heart can be read as “love” or “heart”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include CSS and JavaScript implementations for use on the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping our icons to standard Unicode values not only allowed us to be consistent across &lt;a href=&quot;https://symbolset.com/icons&quot;&gt;all sets&lt;/a&gt; we release, but be interoperable with other font vendors and platforms as well. Our dream was to allow designers to choose an icon font, use it in their layout, and easily swap between icon sets—just as you would with any text font. We’re still pretty happy with how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-more-than-ever&quot;&gt;Now more than ever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are icon fonts still relevant? While some party poopers have declared “&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/ninjanails/death-to-icon-fonts&quot;&gt;death to icon fonts&lt;/a&gt;”, we think that’s a load of 💩 and icon fonts are absolutely the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One only has to look to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.symbolset.com/making-ss-emoji&quot;&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt; and its incredible rise to see why icon fonts are ubiquitous and here to stay. Exactly like Symbolsets, emoji are icon fonts mapped semantically to Unicode values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many emoji fonts, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Color_Emoji&quot;&gt;Apple Color Emoji&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most well known. In a recent study, 92% of online consumers report using emoji&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:stat&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:stat&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That’s a lot of people using icon fonts every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/symbolset-ios10.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 10 features emoji prediction, reminiscent of Symbolset’s keyword functionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ⭐ or 🍔 written in emoji can be shown in Symbolset just the same. Unlike image formats like PNG or SVG, computers understand exactly what ⭐ or 🍔 means. Fonts work on any device with a display, and are future-proof in a way image formats can’t be. For as long as we have text, we’ll have fonts.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:text&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With advancements in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.symbolset.com/multicolor-fonts&quot;&gt;multicolor fonts&lt;/a&gt;, we’re pretty excited about what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-next&quot;&gt;So what’s next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things we haven’t accomplished with Symbolset yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released 15 icon sets from 2012 to 2015, but like traditional typefaces, we think there’s room for infinite more. We believe icon sets should be chosen to reflect your design, and even pair with your typographic choices. Luckily, there are talented icon designers today pushing the craft forward (many of which we’ve been able to work with&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:designers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:designers&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ve always dreamed of working with the Unicode Consortium to create a block for common user interface icons, and open our icon mapping system to other vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.google.com/icons/&quot;&gt;Google pretty much stole it&lt;/a&gt; anyway. They got the keywords mostly right, but unfortunately missed the point of Unicode (this is why we need standards!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say we have huge ambitions for Symbolset, but with our &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;small team&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=&quot;/products&quot;&gt;growing products&lt;/a&gt; we were unfortunately not able to dedicate enough resources to make it sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still feeling passionate about growing Symbolset however, we reached out to everyone from established creative software companies, type foundries, young icon startups, and ultimately found a new home with our buddies at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortawesome.com&quot;&gt;Fort Awesome&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Fonticons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew Symbolset needed a team that is devoted 100% to solving icons, and we think these are the folks to do it. These are the same people who make &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently being used on an incredible 73 million websites. They’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/yc-backed-fonticons-is-a-subscription-icon-service-from-the-creator-of-font-awesome/&quot;&gt;backed by Y-Combinator&lt;/a&gt; and have some exciting things planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be honest, most acquisitions suck. Especially for users who get left behind while the founders run off on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;incredible journey&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t take this lightly and very little money switched hands. We mostly were concerned with finding a team who could continue operating Symbolset as it is, and we worked hard to find the best possible fit for our users. As a user, you shouldn’t have to worry about any disruptions. But look forward to awesome stuff in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close, I thought I’d share our original &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.symbolset.com/purpose&quot;&gt;Symbolset purpose&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make great icon design available to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make icons semantic, meaningful, and accessible to humans and machines alike.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make icons easy to implement and technology-agnostic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make icon design a viable profession for talented icon designers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing Fort Awesome continue this mission, and make icon fonts great again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers to Dave, Travis, and the rest of the Fort Awesome team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduced the world to the all-new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-dropmark&quot;&gt;Dropmark v2&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com/blog/explore-your-dashboard&quot;&gt;newly redesigned dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com/blog/customize-your-collection/&quot;&gt;more customizations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com/blog/improved-thumbnails&quot;&gt;improved thumbnails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropmark.com/blog/cover-images&quot;&gt;cover images&lt;/a&gt;, and our biggest addition: Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked with our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wearecollins.com&quot;&gt;Collins&lt;/a&gt; and helped them launch a new website built on Siteleaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moved our studio from DUMBO in Brooklyn (where we’ve been since 2010) to Union Square in Manhattan. After many years, Studiomates was closed after our building was sadly reconstructed into condos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added another new Symbolset, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.symbolset.com/new-set-ss-community&quot;&gt;SS Community&lt;/a&gt; designed by our friends at Hyperakt.&lt;/p&gt;
