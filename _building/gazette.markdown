[Gazette](http://gazette.io) was an experiment from Oak Studios. It allowed you to subscribe to your favorite blogs, websites, and publications and receive a weekly, personalized ebook to read and highlight on your iPad, iPhone, Kindle, or other device that supported ePub or Mobi formats. It synced issues with Readmill, Kindle, and also allowed you to download directly.

Gazette's last issue was sent on April 25, 2014.
