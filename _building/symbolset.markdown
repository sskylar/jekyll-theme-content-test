[Symbolsets](http://symbolset.com) are semantic symbol fonts. They work in modern browsers and anywhere OpenType features are supported. Our fonts map symbols to semantic keywords instead of letters, the first icon font of its kind to make this happen. The sets are scalable, flexible, and highly accessible.
