GoDaddy is the largest domain name registrar _by far_, with around [32% marketshare](http://www.webhosting.info/registrars/top-registrars/global/) (or around 40,212,493 domain names), according to the website WebHosting.Info.

At Oak, we’ve registered more than a few domain names through GoDaddy—cringing each time Danica Patrick stares us down. But, as the largest registrar, they have the lowest prices, and for the most part, things ‘just work.’ [Recent events](http://mashable.com/2011/03/31/godaddy-ceo-elephant/), however, made us question where our money is going.

In April, we decided to try out [OpenSRS](http://opensrs.com) as a way to manage our growing repertoire in bulk.

Despite the fun branding by illlustrator [John Martz](http://johnmartz.com/), OpenSRS seemed to fall short with their clunky, dated UI (a new version appears to be under development). For the most part, I forgot about it.

Then last week, an unassuming box showed up at the studio:

I recognized the OpenSRS logo, but couldn’t figure out what they would be sending us…

Inside we found an OpenSRS-branded care package complete with a Field Notes-style notebook, pre-sharpened pencil, buttons, and icing-on-the-cake, a vinyl toy recreation of OpenSRS “service guy” mascot. Not your average tchotchkies.

No explanation, no salesy ‘upsell,’ just a box full of fun stuff.

Nice work OpenSRS. You definitely have our attention again.
