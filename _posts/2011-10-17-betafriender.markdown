description: Brooklyn Beta + Twitter API = <a href="http://www.betafriender.com" class="experiments">BetaFriender</a>

Last week we attended [Brooklyn Beta](http://brooklynbeta.org/2011), a small web conference put on by our good friends at [Fictive Kin](http://fictivekin.com) and [Analog](http://analog.coop).

280 of the friendliest, smartest, and most passionate people in the web community came together with the mantra “make something you love.” For those lucky enough to attend (or those interesting in following the Brooklyn Beta crew), we built a little app called [BetaFriender](http://www.betafriender.com).

BetaFriender helps you connect with people might have met at the conference by comparing your recent Twitter followers with the Brooklyn Beta attendee list, and gives you the option to follow them back. Now you can recreate the magic and conversation of Brooklyn Beta in your Twitter feed all year long.

The app was built using Python (and the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/)) on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), over the course of one afternoon.
