Quarterly is “a subscription service for wonderful things.” This online service ships physical items to customers from influential contributors of their choosing. Contributors include  [Tina Roth Eisenberg](http://quarterly.co/contributors/tina-roth-eisenberg "Tina Roth Eisenberg"),  [John Maeda](http://quarterly.co/contributors/john-maeda "John Maeda"),  [Mike Monteiro](http://quarterly.co/contributors/mike-monteiro "Mike Monteiro"),  [Liz Danzico](http://quarterly.co/contributors/liz-danzico "Liz Danzico"), and more. Each contributor sends a themed shipment but the contents of that shipment are a mystery to the subscriber.

The postal service offers a rich visual history. There are common themes honoring couriers, the airmail service, the pony express, and others. We chose a style that would allow us to blend in with contemporary startups while honoring the heritage the postal service offers. We chose to honor the package as the iconic twine-bound box. The perspective on the box creates a unique silhouette.

Package size and shape is different for nearly every shipment. We designed flexible elements such as tape and stamps that can adorn a variety of packages. We specified color and illustration style but the brand remains malleable. The linear style has a sense of nostalgia, can be used to illustrate and letter any number of things, and reproduces well on cardboard and as stamps. The illustrations on the packaging salute about a dozen pop culture references (which Seinfeld character resides in apartment 5E?).

The [website](http://quarterly.co) follows basic commercial patterns. Tactile effects and styles were used in the interface to introduce some of the warmth seen in the packaging.
