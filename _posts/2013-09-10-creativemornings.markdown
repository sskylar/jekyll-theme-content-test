[CreativeMornings](http://creativemornings.com) is a global, monthly breakfast lecture series for creative people. Started in 2008 by [Tina Roth Eisenberg](http://swiss-miss.com), CreativeMornings began in [New York](http://creativemornings.com/cities/nyc) and quickly spread to nearly 60 chapters around the world from [San Francisco](http://creativemornings.com/cities/sf) to [Auckland](http://creativemornings.com/cities/akl).

With a sprawling video library of monthly talks from creative icons like [Milton Glaser](http://creativemornings.com/talks/milton-glaser) and [Erik Spiekermann](http://creativemornings.com/talks/erik-spiekermann), CreativeMornings launched a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/swissmiss/creativemornings-creating-an-archive) last year to create an archive, and bring the global community together.
