[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) hosts pretty much everything we make here at Oak, from our web apps (like [Dropmark](http://dropmark.in)) to this site right here. We can’t say enough good things about them or their [fanatical support](http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/).

Earlier this year, Rackspace launched the [Rackspace Startup Program](http://www.rackspacestartups.com), which aims to help startups launch new products and ideas through a combination of hosting and mentorship.

> …we were just like you in 1998. Since those early days we've been committed to helping entrepreneurs drive the next generation of businesses with our hosting and Fanatical Support. Now, with the Rackspace Startup Program, we're providing cloud hosting and coaching to selected startups so they can rocket to success as well.

We’re extremely thrilled to announce that Oak has been accepted into this program. Over the next year, we’ll be working closely with the Rackspace team to launch and grow our products. This is great news for us and our users.

Thanks Rackspace!
