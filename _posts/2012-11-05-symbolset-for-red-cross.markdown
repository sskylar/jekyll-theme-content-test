In the wake of [Hurricane Sandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy) you can help recovery efforts with a purchase of [SS Social](http://symbolset.com/redcross). During the month of November, 100% of the proceeds will be donated to the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org) disaster relief fund.

The hurricane, which hit the East Coast last week, affected millions of people including ourselves. [Our studio](http://oak.is/sandy) in Brooklyn is still without power a week later, but we are one of the lucky ones. Thousands of people had it much worse and lost their homes, businesses, or loved ones.



Recovery efforts are underway, but it has been estimated that the relief effort may be the most expensive in U.S. history. Here’s a small way to [contribute to the efforts](http://symbolset.com/redcross).

SS Social is a symbol font comprised of logos of web-based services and products. Find out more about it [here](http://symbolset.com/#social).
