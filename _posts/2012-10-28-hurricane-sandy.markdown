Having our studio located on the Brooklyn waterfront has its perks. It also means we are in  [Evacuation Zone A](http://project.wnyc.org/news-maps/hurricane-zones/hurricane-zones.html) when it comes to hurricanes.

Today as we prepped the studio for the megastorm, we set up a [live feed](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/oakstudios) to keep an eye on  [Hurricane Sandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy_(2012)).



In the meantime, we’ll be staying safe in the comfort of our homes.

**UPDATE:** We have a second camera capturing stills over  [Brooklyn Bridge Park](http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/). This image updates every 60 seconds (Oct. 29, 1pm):

**UPDATE 2:** Our live feed just died and our studio is [surrounded by water](http://pic.twitter.com/PVvIlWna), looks like that’s it for the live feed tonight. Our still image feed is still going strong…for now. (Oct. 29, 7:50pm)

**UPDATE 3:** With the internet down in most of the city, our still image feed is also down. (Oct. 29, 10pm)

**UPDATE 4:** Thankfully we all made it through the storm safe and sound. We uploaded a [timelapse](/thinking/sandycam-timelapse) of the events yesterday in case you missed it. An archive of the live videos can be seen on [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/oakstudios). (Oct. 30, 3:30pm)
