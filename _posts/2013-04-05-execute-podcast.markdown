[Execute](http://theindustry.cc/2013/04/05/execute-podcast-1-oak-studios/) is a new podcast by [Josh Long](http://joshlong.me) and [Drew Wilson](http://drewwilson.com) about people who execute on ideas immediately when inspired rather than following the normal rules.

We were lucky enough to be their first guests in this new series, and chatted about the making of our latest product [Gazette](http://gazette.io).

Listen to the episode over on [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/2013/04/05/execute-podcast-1-oak-studios/) or download it on [iTunes](http://itun.es/i6JW5Dd).
