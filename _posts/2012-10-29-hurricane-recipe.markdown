With [Hurricane Sandy](/thinking/hurricane-sandy) above us, what better time to drink a hurricane? Making your very own hurricane is simple. You’ll need:

- [Gosling’s Black Seal Rum](http://www.goslingsrum.com/microsites/blackseal.php)
- [Pat O’Brien’s Hurricane Mix](http://www.amazon.com/Pat-OBriens-Famous-Hurricane-Cocktail/dp/B0012UV1BY) (or juice, see below)
- Orange slice
- Maraschino cherries



If available use Pat O’Brien’s Hurricane Mix. Don’t have it? To make your own you’ll additionally need:

- 4oz passion fruit juice
- Half a lime
- 2oz squeezed orange juice

Juice the lime half into a cocktail shaker with ice. Add the other ingredients and shake well (this should yield enough for two hurricanes).

Fill your favorite festive glass with crushed ice. Pour in your liquid hurricane mix about half way, and fill the rest with Gosling’s. Garnish with an orange slice and cherry.
