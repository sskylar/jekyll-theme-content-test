Today we're happy to launch a refined and better [Gazette](http://gazette.io)!

Gazette now supports Kindle, and a new Explore section where you can discover some of the favorite subscriptions amongst the community.

You can download previous issues in Kindle format from your account page, and you can connect your account for automatically delivery of future issues.

Lastly, a gentle reminder that today is the last day that Google Reader will be in operation. If you want to move any subscriptions over to Gazette, today would be the day.

If you enjoy Gazette, help us [spread the word](http://twitter.com/gazette)!
