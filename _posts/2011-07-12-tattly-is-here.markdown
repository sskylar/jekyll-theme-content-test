  designers look badass.
---

Over the past few weeks our team had the pleasure of working with Tina Roth Eisenberg (better known as [swissmiss](http://swiss-miss.com)) on a project that can only be described as badass (if only _temporarily_ badass).

Today we’re thrilled to announce the launch of [Tattly](http://tatt.ly).

Tattly is line of temporary tattoos by designers for designers and design-minded kids. The idea came to Tina after applying several embarrassing “clip art” tattoos on her daughter (seriously, who makes [this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=166050011)?).




> Tattly started out of my frustration that temporary children tattoos are often hideous looking. Think clip art gone Tattoo. I was ready to put designy, cool, typographic tattoos on my daughter’s arm. Tattly was born.

— Tina Roth Eisenberg

The first group of Tattlys were created by a diverse group of designers including James Victore, Frank Chimero, Jessica Hische, and Jason Santa Maria. You can satisfy your inner [(type) nerd](http://tatt.ly/products/type-nerd) with [cursors](http://tatt.ly/products/cursors), [color wheels](http://tatt.ly/products/color-burst), [robots](http://tatt.ly/products/robot), and more (or just buy them [all](http://tatt.ly/products/everything)). New Tattly designs will be announced on an ongoing basis.

If you’re not lucky enough to have a [Tattly vending machine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rustyameadows/5925849639/) in your office (it tops our list of perks), you can buy ’em online at [http://tatt.ly](http://tatt.ly), built by yours truly.

The shop runs on [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/?ref=oak), which was almost as painless to set up as applying a Tattly to your bicep. Shopify also has some useful add-on apps like [PixelPrinter](http://apps.shopify.com/pixelprinter), which makes it a snap to print shipping labels and receipts, and [Chimpified](http://apps.shopify.com/chimpified), which syncs customer information with MailChimp.

The entire shop follows responsive design principles, meaning you’ll have no problems ordering a Tattly from your iPhone (because you never know when you’ll need a Tattly on the go).
