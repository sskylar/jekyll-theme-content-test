[Symbolsets](http://symbolset.com) are semantic symbol fonts.

Our fonts map symbols to semantic keywords instead of letters (in short, you can type “heart” to get a ♥), the first icon font of its kind to make this happen. They work in modern browsers and anywhere OpenType features are supported.

We are launching with two sets: Standard and Social, designed by our very own Mike Fortress. We hope to announce additional sets from other designers in the coming weeks.

A lot of work has gone into this and we're thrilled to finally show it off.
