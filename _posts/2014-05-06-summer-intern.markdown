We are looking for a talented person to join our Brooklyn-based studio for a summer internship.

At [Oak](http://oak.is) we create products like [Dropmark](http://dropmark.com), [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) and [Symbolset](http://symbolset.com), and make things for clients including [CreativeMornings](/helping/creativemornings), [Working Not Working](/helping/working-not-working), and the [School of Visual Arts](/helping/sva).

As an intern, you’ll have the opportunity to learn, hone your skills, and contribute valuable work to real projects—not go on coffee runs (unless that’s something you’re passionate about).



We are located at [Studiomates](http://studiomates.com) in Dumbo[^1], a collaborative workspace buzzing with creative energy and friendly people. We also have [decent views](http://www.flickr.com/photos/shiflett/4326075208/in/pool-studiomates) of Brooklyn Bridge Park, [nerdy toys](http://instagram.com/p/WVPtJ-SWhB/), a [semi-fictitious bar](http://www.barlawrence.com), ~~and a beach located right downstairs~~[^2].

You should have:

- Design and/or web development skills
- Strong portfolio, with bonus points for self-initiated projects
- Eagerness to learn new things
- Self-motivated, problem-solving attitude
- Strong writing and communication skills

This is a paid internship, commitment is flexible. 

Sound like you? Send an e-mail to [jobs+intern@oakmade.com](mailto:jobs+intern@oakmade.com) and introduce yourself.

[^2]: Update: [The beach](https://foursquare.com/v/dumbo-beach-brooklyn-ny/520d446904930e19245b03ab) is no longer.
