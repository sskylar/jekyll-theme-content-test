There’s nothing like a roaring fire to make the season bright.

This season we transformed our studio into a [cozy wonderland](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/sets/72157628530564181/), complete with festive [yuletide log](http://www.amazon.com/GHP-Group-Pleasant-Hearth-Crackling/dp/B001NFSXIW/) and  [IdeaPaint](http://www.ideapaint.com/) mantle (thanks to Mike and Alonzo for the whiteboard handiwork).

Since it’s the season of giving, we’re delighted to [pass this experience on to you](http://vimeo.com/34062274). Gather around your laptop, [play in fullscreen](http://oak.is/festive), and feel the warmth. You'll swear you're sitting by the fire at [Studiomates](http://studiomates.com).



Our fireplace “mantle” also made for a perfect place to “hang” our [stockings from last year](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/sets/72157625542484922/). Huge thanks to Tattly magician and studiomate Bekka for [making stockings](http://www.mintedcondition.com/filled-cheer) for the new studiomates this year, including our very own [Mike Fortress](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/6557857757/in/set-72157628530564181/), [Alonzo Felix](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/6557853929/in/set-72157628530564181/), and [Larry Fox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/6557858943/in/set-72157628530564181) (intern [Sawyer Hollenshead](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oakmade/6557856763/in/set-72157628530564181/) was excited to make his own).

See you in 2012!
