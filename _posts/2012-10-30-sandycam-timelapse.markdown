Yesterday as Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, an overwhelming 200,000 people tuned into the  [live feed](/thinking/hurricane-sandy) broadcasting from our studio in DUMBO.

Our cameras (and internet connection) died eventually, but we were able to piece together this [timelapse](https://vimeo.com/52486916) showing the rising water levels in Brooklyn Bridge Park from 1:00 pm to 7:30 pm Eastern time.



Archives from our Manhattan Bridge live feed can be seen at  [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/oakstudios).

Thankfully we all made it through the storm safe and sound, and hope to be back in the studio tomorrow.
