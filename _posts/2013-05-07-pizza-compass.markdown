Hello. I'm Zeus Gorham Munkist. I consider myself an ordinary man. I put my pants on one leg at a time. I like walks on the beach and enjoy a nice cup of coffee in the morning. Let me tell you a story about how my ordinary life changed forever.





Sure, I collected Beanie Babies in the 90s, a man has to make money somehow right? Well, that didn't work out so well. I next tried my hand as an A/C repairman in south New Mexico but discovered I didn't enjoy hanging off balconies much. Another career attempt was as a sport fisherman in South Texas, but the fish left me empty inside. I was broke, alone, and headed nowhere slowly filled with deep, depressing dissatisfaction.

It was then, at the end of my rope on a cold winter night, that I accidentally made the greatest discovery of our time. I found love in a hopeless place in my life while stumbling half conscious into some sort of pepperoni and dough-filled heaven. Here were ordinary people like me smiling and having an amazing time seated around these circles of truth. It felt like a perfect combination of geometry, triangles slicing away through the circles and into my soul. The thin crust restored my trust. Its cheese brought me to my knees and I wept openly, uncaring what the world would think of me. I had found pizza.

There comes a time in every man's life when hard choices have to  be made. Where a fork in the road appears. It was an easy choice. I took the road paved with pizza. I hired [Daniel Blackman](http://dblackman.com) and [Oak Studios](http://oak.is) to make the finest app the world has ever known. Life getting you down? There's an app for that and it's called [Pizza Compass](http://pizza-compass.com), your tool for sliced success.
