Oak is an independent design-led product studio based&nbsp;in [sunny](http://forecast.io/#/f/40.6776231,-73.9935831){: .weather} Brooklyn, New York. We make creative products like [Dropmark](http://www.dropmark.com) and [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com), and work on a number of [other ventures](/building).

Since 2008, we have [partnered with](/helping) startups and leading companies like Facebook, Apple, Spotify, and UNICEF to design interfaces, develop apps, and solve problems. We're not a VC firm, but we occasionally [invest in our favorite ideas](/building).

We believe in building self-sustaining, purposeful products. We tend to build products that scratch our itch, products that we want to exist in this world. As users ourselves, we care deeply about the user experience and building products that last.

As a team we enjoy blurring the lines of design and engineering, and encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration as much as possible. [Join us](/hiring)!
