summary: Developing an iOS app to showcase SVAâ€™s talented young designers.
---

Oak was selected to develop the School of Visual Arts (SVA) Design and Advertising Portfolio app. Designed for iPhone and iPad, the app allows you to explore the portfolios and work of the graduating class of the Advertising and Design Departments.

Featuring graphic design, advertising, motion graphics, interactive design, and 3D design work, the app gives potential employers the opportunity to find the most talented young designers for their company, startup, or project.

The first version of the app was released in 2013, and we've worked with SVA each year since to produce a new version.

Available free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/school-visual-arts-design/id433686061?mt=8).
