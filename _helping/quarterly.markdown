[Quarterly Co.](http://quarterly.co) is a subscription service that allows subscribers to receive themed shipments in the mail from influential contributors of their choice every three months. The shipments each tell a compelling story crafted by the contributor and provide tangible delight to the recipient each time.

Beginning in 2010, Oak worked closely with Quarterly founders on ideation, naming, brand identity, design, and development. The e-commerce storefront was built with Ruby on Rails, with custom integration with Quarterly's fulfillment warehouse.

We also designed a unique award-winning packaging system based on the rich visual history of the postal service, along with complete refresh in 2013.
