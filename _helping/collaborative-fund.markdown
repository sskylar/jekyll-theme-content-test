  better.

[Collaborative Fund](http://www.collaborativefund.com/) is an investment fund focused on supporting and investing in the shared future. The fund centers around two macro themes which they believe will be driving business innovation in the coming years: the growth of the creative class and the concept of collaborative consumption.

We worked with our friends at Collaborative Fund to design and develop their online brand.
