[Village](http://vllg.com/) is the union of 11 type foundries who have decided to go it alone together. Village has a beautiful library of typefaces, curated by Chester and Tracy Jenkins.

Village 3.0 called for a completely new design and an overhaul of the site's backend. We worked with Chester and Tracy to refine their design, and develop a front- and back-end to bring it to life. Offering webfont sales for the first time, the website also includes a live in-browser typeface tester utiziling HTML5.
