Oak has worked with temporary tattoo empire [Tattly](http://tattly.com) on a number of projects since 2011, including their Shopify-powered e-commerce storefront.

In 2012, a companion [Gift](https://gift.tattly.com) storefront was launched. Developed as a custom Ruby on Rails app, the Gift site uses the Shopify API and Stripe for payments.
