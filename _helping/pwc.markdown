In 2010, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) relaunched its brand identity and wanted an exciting, visual way to introduce the new look to its employees. Working with PwC’s branding agency, Oak developed an internal iPad app which functioned as a kiosk in hundreds of locations across North America—including the flagship office in New York City.

The app allowed employees to build and order a custom PwC laptop bag in one of four color palettes. The app was built to work both on the iPad as well as on PwC’s local intranet.
