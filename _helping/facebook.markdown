summary: Improving the location discovery experience in Facebookâ€™s flagship mobile
  apps.
---

For a few months in late 2014, we joined the team at Facebook to bring our design thinking, help iterate, and improve upon location discovery in the flagship Facebook app. Working with Facebook's in-house development team, we focused on updating the visual style of Nearby Places screens to be consistent with the rest of the app, improving the user experience, and help shape a vision for where things could be taken in the future.
