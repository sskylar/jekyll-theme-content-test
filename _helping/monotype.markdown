It's no secret, at Oak we love type. As such we were thrilled to design a consumer-facing site for the SkyFonts service offered by Monotype Imaging, a leading global provider of fonts and related technologies.

We collaborated with the team at Monotype to design the site using their existing branding, while their capable programmers handled the development.
