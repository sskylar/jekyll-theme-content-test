[Studiobooth](http://thestudiobooth.com) is a mobile photo studio that lets an event photograph itself. Oak designed and developed an iPad app that ties in with the Facebook, Twitter, and SmugMug APIs, creating a platform that taps into the power of social media to build brand recognition. After being photographed, event attendees can view their photos on iPads in real-time and share them via email or social media.

Clients have full control over the iPad interface with built-in options to acquire emails, sign release forms, insert branded messages, build Twitter followers and Facebook fans, and upload images directly to a company Facebook page. The application has been used at events around the world by companies including Nike, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and more.

Oak also worked with StudioBooth to create their website and blog, powered by [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) with integration with the SmugMug API.
